 we have used the `frameset` element to divide the web page into two rows. The `rows` attribute is set to "100,*", where the first row has a fixed height of 100 pixels, and the second row takes up the remaining space.
 We have also included one `frame` elements within the `frameset`. The first `frame` has a `src` attribute set to "title.html.
 Add the first column: Within the newly created row, add the HTML elements that represent the content of the first column.`
We have also included one `frame` elements within the `frameset`. The first `frame` has a `src` attribute set to "bluediamond.html.
Add the second column: Similarly, within the same row, add the HTML elements that represent the content of the second column.
We have also included one `frame` elements within the `frameset`. The second `frame` has a `src` attribute set to "form.html.
The <noframes> tag is the backup for those browsers that does not support frames. This tag can contains all the element that can be placed in <body> tag.
